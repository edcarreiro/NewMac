# Auto Installation for new Apple Macs

Two script files to install automatically a lot of apps and resources when I re-format or buy a new Mac!

Almost all my apps are installed. Only some of then do not work  (**SETAPP, Paragon NTFS and a little more**).

I had to separate in two steps, because the part of iTerm2 and OH-My-ZSH must be installed first (**POWERLEVEL10K** must be installed manually after the 1-pre-install.sh.)
